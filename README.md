# 🎟️ BookMyShow Clone

This is a **frontend-only project** built to demonstrate **movie API integration** and **payment gateway configuration** in a real-world ticket booking flow. It simulates the core experience of BookMyShow, including browsing movies and making secure ticket payments—all without a backend.
